# openSUSE Salt Packaging

This repository tracks [upstream salt](https://github.com/saltstack/salt) and the patches for the [openSUSE salt package](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/systemsmanagement:saltstack/salt).

See [here](https://github.com/openSUSE/salt/wiki/Git-.config-for-working-with-remote-repositories) for working with remote git repositories.
## Branches

* `develop` - upstream development
* `2015.8` - upstream branch for 2015.8.X bugfixes
* `openSUSE-2015.8.3` - openSUSE branch for the [openSUSE salt package](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/systemsmanagement:saltstack/salt)

The `openSUSE-2015.8.3` branch is based on the `v2015.8.3` upstream tag. Commits on the `openSUSE-2015.8.3` branch apply cleanly on the `salt-2015.8.3.tar.gz` release tarball.
