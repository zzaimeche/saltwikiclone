# openSUSE Salt Packaging

This repository tracks [upstream salt](https://github.com/saltstack/salt) and the patches for the [openSUSE salt package](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/systemsmanagement:saltstack/salt).

See [here](https://github.com/openSUSE/salt/wiki/Git-.config-for-working-with-remote-repositories) for working with remote git repositories.
## Branches

* `develop` - upstream development
* `2015.8` - upstream branch for 2015.8.X bugfixes
* `openSUSE-2015.8.3` - openSUSE branch for the [openSUSE salt package](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/systemsmanagement:saltstack/salt)

The `openSUSE-2015.8.3` branch is based on the `v2015.8.3` upstream tag. Commits on the `openSUSE-2015.8.3` branch apply cleanly on the `salt-2015.8.3.tar.gz` release tarball.

## Workflow

### Policies

* :warning: **Always** try to keep patches merged to the upstream, if your patch is related to the source. If upstream does not likes the fix, try to find a compromise and try having no patches that aren't upstream. 
* :warning: **Always** open Pull Requests for your fixes upstream and never on openSUSE branch. The openSUSE branch exists merely for the accepted-ready commits that were already discussed.
* Keep patches local as long as they do not need to be posted upstream and are package-related, outside of the source code tarball.
* Pick only the changes from the upstream that are verified and/or are really needed (e.g. required fix won't get in without related changes).
* **Preferably** add patches only after they were already accepted upstream and passed all the checks they run themselves separately. This is not always the case, but keeps you at the safe side.
* **Always** squash numerous patches per a topic, so you will end-up with just few physical patches in the package, instead of many.

### Submitting to build.opensuse.org

* Only submit to `systemsmanagement:saltstack:testing/salt`
* :warning: Check `systemsmanagement:saltstack/salt` for changes introduced by `openSUSE:Factory`
  (Yes, the `openSUSE:Factory` maintainers can introduce changes by themselves just to keep Factory working)

### Request push access
* Go to https://github.com/orgs/openSUSE/teams/salt
* Press "Request to join"
* As soon as your request is approved, you can continue with the steps below

### An example adding a new patch to the 2015.8.3 package
* Checkout the `openSUSE-2015.8.3` branch
* Add the fix, using `cherry-pick` of the range from the corresponding upstream branch. In case of conflicts (they usually are normal) fix them in place.
* Commit the fix to the `openSUSE-2015.8.3` branch
* Run `git format-patch v2015.8.3` against this **tag**
* :warning: If you have more than one patch files appeared, squash them into one file, leaving all the commit messages as one big message. See "Changing an existing patch" part below.
* Add the latest `.patch` file to the package
* Build the package
* Test the package
* :warning: Perform the final `git push` **only** if package is built and all the tests passes!

### Changing an existing patch
* Checkout the `openSUSE-2015.8.3` branch
* Run `git rebase -i v2015.8.3` â€” this will open your `$EDITOR`
* In case to correct something within the commit, change `pick` to `edit` of the patch you want to change, then save and exit your editor
* In case to merge many commits into one, use [`squash` technique](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html).
* Change the file(s)
* `git add`, `git commit`, `git rebase --continue`
* Run `git format-patch v2015.8.3`
* Move all `.patch` files to the package
* Build the package
* Test the package
* `git push -f` if tests passes. Pushing with `--force` is perfectly OK.

### Upgrade to a new upstream release

Example: New 2015.8.x release

Assumptions:
* Old openSUSE branch: `openSUSE-2015.8.3`, based on `v2015.8.3`
* New release `v2015.8.4`
* New openSUSE branch: `openSUSE-2015.8.4` based on `v2015.8.4`

* `git fetch upstream` to get your repo up-to-date compared to upstream
* `git fetch opensuse` to get your repo up-to-date compared to openSUSE

* `git checkout openSUSE-2015.8.3`
  to go to the `openSUSE-2015.8.3` branch

* `git pull opensuse openSUSE-2015.8.3`
  to get up-to-date with the openSUSE patches

* `git checkout 2015.8`
  to go to the `2015.8` branch

* `git pull upstream 2015.8`
  to get the latest branch state from upstream

* `git checkout v2015.8.4`
  to place git HEAD to the upstream release tag

* `git checkout -b openSUSE-2015.8.4`
  to create the new openSUSE release branch

* `git cherry-pick v2015.8.3..openSUSE-2015.8.3`
  to move all patches from the old openSUSE release branch to the new one.
  This will automagically detect patches that were merge upstream.
  You might run into conflicts if a openSUSE patch touches the same code area as an upstream commit.
  Go fix these conflicts, then `git add ...`, `git cherry-pick --continue` resp. `git cherry-pick --allow-empty`

* `git push opensuse openSUSE-2015.8.4`
  to push the new branch to opensuse
