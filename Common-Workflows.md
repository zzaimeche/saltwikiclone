#### Diffs, Listing Packages, Aligning Sub-projects

This [bash script](https://gist.github.com/agraul/067922320b9d429aec744b48990120ff) is useful to list all packages in the bundle sub-project, look at the `osc rdiff` for each of them in the respective subproject of the two defined parent projects and for `osc copypac` or `prjconf` alignments.
