Highlights:

- Python 3!
- Test are now utilising Pytest
- No more Python 6 (and no more RHEL6!)
- pillar encryption: now SLS files
- Grain `osmajorrelease` is now `integer` type.
- `module.run` has two implementations with a different syntax. Additinal feature is coming extra: to specify what implementation one would like to use at _the very moment_ inside the SLS.
- Wildcard versions: like everyone `1.2.3.*` but SUSE can also `1*.2.3` or `*3` or any other SHELL file matching pattern.
- Master can authenticate and get the authorization from the different auth modules
- Big changes to Jinja templates.
- Now you can do logging from Jinja!
- Many improvements on NAPALM network automation module (introduced in 2016.11)
- Lots of Docker support improvements
- salt.roster.cache was rewritten from scratch. Now it supports all minion matchers,
  so it is same as salt and salt-ssh
- roster_order configuration syntax is now possible to compose a roster
  out of any combination of grains, pillar and mine data and even Salt SDB URLs.
  It supports IPv4 and IPv6 enabled and has full support for CIDR ranges 
  (Classless Inter-Domain Routing).
- New modules:
  beacons.log
  cache.redis_cache
  engines.stalekey
  modules.heat
  modules.boto3 (a lot)
  modules.icinga2
  modules.logmod
  output.table_out
  pillar.postgres

Deprecations:
- No support aliasing cmd.run to cmd.shell
- Dulwitch module for GitFS dropped
- Beacon config are now lists, no more dicts
- client_acl configuration gone. Now publisher_acl.
- client_acl_blacklist is now publisher_acl_blacklist
- wipe_ssh is now ssh_wipe
- some states use no more "disable/enable" but "disabled/enabled"
